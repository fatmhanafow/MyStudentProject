# Dictionary Project (BST Implementation)

This is a simple dictionary application using a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. It stores English words and allows you to perform basic operations like inserting words, searching for words, deleting words, and displaying them in various traversal orders (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order). The tree structure can be saved to a CSV file for future use.

## Features

- **Insert a word**: Add new English words to the tree.
- **Search for a word**: Find out if a specific word exists in the dictionary.
- **Delete a word**: Remove a word from the dictionary.
- **Traversal**: Display the dictionary in In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals.
- **Save to CSV**: Save the dictionary to a CSV file for backup or sharing.
